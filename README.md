This is a framework for logging predictions (making bets) against the results provided by the SportsRadar API. 
It aims to allow for the flexible design of many different types of predictions and to be reusable with other sports as well.
The project uses the Object-Oriented paradigm with the goal of creating a versatile and expansive framework for making sports predictions.
